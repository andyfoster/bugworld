# Andy's Bug World


## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create two objects of class Bug using each constructor.

- [x] Task 2: Create a new method that asks the user to manually input values for the attributes (using a Scanner and System.in).

- [ ] Task 3: Using an ArrayList, store 3 different bugs.

- [ ] Task 4: Create a "move" method in Bug that can move the bug in one of the the four directions on a compass (N, S, E, W). At this point there is no concept of the size of the world, so it is ok to be in position x=-1 and y=-1.

- [ ] Task 5: Create a test where one bug moves 100 times in random directions (using Math.random()).
