# Andy's Bug World


## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create two objects of class Bug using each constructor.

- [x] Task 2: Create a new method that asks the user to manually input values for the attributes (using a Scanner and System.in).

- [ ] Task 3: Using an ArrayList, store 3 different bugs.

- [ ] Task 4: Create a "move" method in Bug that can move the bug in one of the the four directions on a compass (N, S, E, W). At this point there is no concept of the size of the world, so it is ok to be in position x=-1 and y=-1.

- [ ] Task 5: Create a test where one bug moves 100 times in random directions (using Math.random()).


## Later (we haven't covered this yet!)

- Using inheritance create 3 different types of bugs that inherit their behaviours from Bug. At this point the only difference between the different types should be their default species and symbol.

As part of this exercise make sure you understand:

- the difference between objects and classes
- inheritance
- different levels of access modifiers (private and public that we've seen, and "protected" that is visible through the inheritance hierarchy)
